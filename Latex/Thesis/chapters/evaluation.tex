\chapter{Evaluation} 

% Movement open loop
Open loop motion control of a robot often results in undesired drift in the position estimation.
Often being a result of unbalances or misalignment in the construction of the robot.

– Uneven wheel slip
– Uneven weight distribution
– Unbalance in driveline, motor to pcb or motor shaft → wheel

% - Weight vs current consumption vs distance
% - Measure start motor overhead and average consumption (show graph?)
% - Table with power consumption of each component at 2.2v ?? only active or also standy?

\section{Controlled movements}



% outdoors/indoors/varying light sources/varying solar panels

% comparison with battery powered robot

% accuracy of motion path
