\section{Limitations and Future Work}

% Study reducing the frequency of power interrupts ie smaller energy buffer.
% How does this effect the accuracy of locomotion?

% Add a low power communcation method for control of multple (swarm)
% Use custom pcb with MCU + communication circuit instead of WISP

% Use ambient light sensor input to do path planning

% Scalable collective check part kilobot
% Not only charging but also programming and activation!

% different locomotion types?

% Combine intermittent computation with swarm operating system.
% Currently single robot and kind of checkpointing, but multi robot swarms require more advanced software?

% Buzz: An Extensible Programming Language for Heterogeneous Swarm Robotics \cite{pinciroli_iros_2016}
