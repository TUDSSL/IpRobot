\label{sec:design_requirements}

% 1 Incomming power V * I which scales with solar panel size

% 2 Maximum power point tracking (switchmode boost converter)

% 3 Stored in non-ideal supercapacitor with capcitiy C and a parrallel resistance Rleak and series resistance (ESR, typically small but not neglectable?)

% 123 determine chargetime

% Buck converter losses 

% Power consumed from source = Pcons = Ploss + Pweels
