\newcommand{\reportAbstract}{
	%Small robotic platforms have become increasingly popular as an educational toy for kids and are widely used by researchers to study swarm behavior with a collective of robots.
	Collectives of miniature robots are envisioned to have future applications in surveillance, search and rescue, and exploration. 
	Before these robots can become applicable in real world applications, a fundamental challenge related to energy needs to be addressed first.
	The operation time of these robots is currently limited by the energy stored in batteries.
	New advancements in batteries are not expected to happen anytime soon, as history shows that new battery technologies are slow emerging.
	This thesis proposes to replace the battery with an energy harvester and temporarily store harvested energy in a supercapacitor.
	However, this creates a new phenomenon to take into consideration; the intermittent source of energy results in very frequent power interrupts.
	Intermittentcy is currently not taken into account when developing a robot, and its effect on control techniques and locomotion are unexplored.
	In this work a transiently-powered battery-free robot is developed that purely operates from harvested energy.
	Energy is harvested from light and using a lighting setup containing four halogen lamps the robot is able to move with a 16\% power duty cycle.
	Using local feedback the robot is able to preform controlled movements, while peristent state variables enable the robot to save the movement progress across power cycles.
	The performance of the transiently-powered robot is evaluated and shows minimal increased deviation from its path when compared to its battery powered equal, given an experimentially determined minimum interrupt period of 0.3\,s.
