Observations:
pwm50 an interrupt every 0.25 sec is uncontrollale
Lower speed requires longer time between interrupts
Higher speed + more interrupts results in more drift to the left, because of wheel more in the back or weaker motor?

Is distance between power interrupts interesting?

Stepper motor was very inefficient ie only 3 cm per powercycle -> problematic for controlloop

# Camera Experiments:
Camera set on auto

Circle PWM70 becomes hard to accurately turn with interrupt every 1.25 sec	

Turn_right speed should be high enough to turn within 30 sec

RPM70 square of 60x60
RPM50 square of 50x50
RPM30 square of 50x50

Hoe de interrupts uitkomen op de beweging heeft invloed!!

Lager snelheid en minder interrupts is hogere precisie??
