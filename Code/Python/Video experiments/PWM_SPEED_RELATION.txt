Observations:
pwm50 a interrupt every 0.25 sec is uncontrollale
Lower speed is need bigger longer time between interrupts
Higher speed + more interrupts results in more drift to the left, because of wheel more in the back or weaker motor?

Is distance between power interrupts interesting?

Stepper motor was very inefficient ie only 3 cm per powercycle -> problematic for controlloop
