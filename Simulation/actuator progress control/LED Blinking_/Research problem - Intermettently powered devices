Intermettently powered devices

## Simple version of the problem:

How to blinking intermettently powered ELD hundard times with x % accuracy?

# Problem description:
Intermettently powered devices can die any time, which leads to losing the progress state of the device.
For the problem of blinking an LED 100 times, one might think that it is possible to use a counter and save its value
after/before each LED blink in the non-volatile memory. This is an ill solution for the following problem. Imagine that
a counter is placed before the LED.  Although with very high chance you will increase the counter and the LED will blink, 
but with a non-negiligeable probablity you will increase the counter and the device will die before blinking the LED. 
Likewise, if the counter is placed after the LED, the LED might blink and the device die before increasing the counter. 

## The more complicated version of the problem
How to moving an intermettenly powered micro-robot from position A to B?




##### Just an idea about a possible solution !!
1- keeping two counters before and after the LED.
2- keeping two counters before and after the LED. Exchange the position of these counters to randomize the error on them
3- combine 1 and 2 (four counters)
